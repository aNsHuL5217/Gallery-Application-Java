- Zoom Functionality: Zoom in and out using scaling.
- Rotate Image: Rotate left or right in 90-degree increments.
- Save Image: Save the currently displayed (or transformed) image to file.
- High-Quality Rendering: Uses Graphics2D for anti-aliased and high-quality image transformations.

** Technologies Used **
- Java AWT & Swing – for GUI and event handling
- Graphics2D – for rendering transformations like zooming and rotating
- File & ImageIO – for file browsing and image operations
